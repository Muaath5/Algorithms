# Brute Force Algorithm

A brute-force algorithm is a simple and straightforward algorithmic approach to solve a problem by considering all possible solutions and selecting the best one among them. In other words, it is a method of exhaustive search that involves checking every possible solution to a problem to find the optimal or acceptable solution.

Brute-force algorithms are often used when there are no known efficient algorithms or when the input size is small enough to make the computational time reasonable. However, as the input size grows, the computational time required by a brute-force algorithm can quickly become impractical or even infeasible.

For example, if we wanted to find the smallest number in a list of integers, a brute-force algorithm would involve checking each number in the list one by one until we find the smallest one. Similarly, if we wanted to crack a password, a brute-force algorithm would involve trying every possible combination of characters until we find the correct one.

While brute-force algorithms can be useful in some situations, they are not always the best approach for solving a problem.
