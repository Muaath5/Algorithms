# Brute Force Algorithm

A brute-force algorithm is a simple and straightforward algorithmic approach to solve a problem by considering all possible solutions and selecting the best one among them. In other words, it is a method of exhaustive search that involves checking every possible solution to a problem to find the optimal or acceptable solution.

For example, if we wanted to find the smallest number in a list of integers, a brute-force algorithm would involve checking each number in the list one by one until we find the smallest one. Similarly, if we wanted to crack a password, a brute-force algorithm would involve trying every possible combination of characters until we find the correct one.
