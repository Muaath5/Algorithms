# Number theory 
Number theory is a branch of mathematics that deals with the properties and behavior of integers. Number theory algorithms are used to solve problems related to integers, such as prime factorization, modular arithmetic, and Diophantine equations.

Some common number theory algorithms include:

1- Euclidean algorithm: used to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two integers.

2- Sieve of Eratosthenes: used to find all prime numbers up to a given limit.

3- Extended Euclidean algorithm: used to find the coefficients of the Bezout's identity, which can be used to solve linear Diophantine equations.

4- Chinese remainder theorem: used to solve systems of congruences.

5- Euler's totient function: used to find the number of integers less than a given integer that are coprime to it.

6- Fermat's little theorem and Euler's theorem: used to calculate modular inverses and to perform modular exponentiation.

7- Pollard's rho algorithm and quadratic sieve: used to factor large integers into primes.

8- Miller-Rabin primality test: used to determine if a given number is prime.

Number theory algorithms are important in cryptography, where they are used to develop secure encryption and decryption schemes. They are also used in computer science, engineering, and other fields where integers are used.
